        <h2>Problem Statement for CSCE 190</h2>
        <p>The professors of UofSC usually use Blackboard to post assignments, but there are some that post assignments on other platforms and it makes it harder to find what assignments you have to do for each class. It would be a lot simpler if they had their assignments in one spot.</p>

          Aperture Dale is the persona I made. He works at Aperture Labs and is doing his training courses. He has a middling level of experience with most technology. He would benefit from the assignment manager because of the subpar organization in the training courses.
